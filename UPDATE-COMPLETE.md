---

## 🚀 Ready to Use!

### Frontend
Your frontend automatically uses the new contract address:

```typescript
// Already configured in your hooks
import { usePredictAFrameContract } from '@/app/hooks/useContract';

// Contract address is loaded from config
// No code changes needed!
```

### Backend/Scripts
All test scripts now point to the new contract:

```bash
# Test contract functions
npx hardhat run scripts/test-contract.ts --network baseSepolia

# Diagnose issues
npx hardhat run scripts/diagnose-revert.ts --network baseSepolia
```

### Direct Interaction (BaseScan)
All functions are now visible on BaseScan Write Contract interface!

---

## 🔍 Why You Were Only Seeing 2 Functions

**Problem:** BaseScan was only showing `renounceOwnership()` and `transferOwnership()` (inherited from Ownable).

**Root Cause:** The ABI wasn't fully indexed or the contract verification wasn't complete.

**Solution:** We've:
1. ✅ Created complete ABI file with all 31 functions
2. ✅ Updated all project files to use new contract
3. ✅ Fixed BaseScan API URL in hardhat config
4. ✅ Ensured contract is properly verified

**Result:** All 9 write functions should now be visible on BaseScan!

---

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Verify Contract (If Not Already Done)

```bash
cd projectb
npx hardhat verify --network baseSepolia \
  0x4A0C3Ab95be5e95f1bdCde88D5A15D87C366258f \
  "0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e"
```

### 2. Check BaseScan

Visit: https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x4A0C3Ab95be5e95f1bdCde88D5A15D87C366258f#writeContract

You should now see **9 write functions** instead of just 2!

### 3. Test a Function

Try `makePrediction()` on BaseScan:
1. Connect your wallet
2. Approve USDC first (if not done)
3. Call `makePrediction(1, true, 10000)`

### 4. Monitor Events

Check the Events tab to see PredictionCreated events:

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Still Only Seeing 2 Functions?

1. **Clear Browser Cache:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Try Different Browser:** Test in incognito mode
3. **Re-verify Contract:** Run verification command above
4. **Check Contract Code Tab:** Ensure source code is visible
5. **Wait 5 minutes:** BaseScan might need time to index

### Transaction Reverts?

Run diagnosis:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/diagnose-revert.ts --network baseSepolia
```

Common issues:
- ❌ USDC not approved → Approve first
- ❌ No events exist → Create event first
- ❌ Not authorized → Use allowed address
