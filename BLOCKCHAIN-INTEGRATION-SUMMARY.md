# Blockchain Integration Enhancement Summary

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Enhancement:** LiveMarketFeed Component Now Uses Real Blockchain Data

---

## 🎯 What Was Changed

The `LiveMarketFeed` component has been upgraded from using mock data to displaying **real blockchain events** from your deployed PredictAFrame smart contract on Base Sepolia.

---

## ✅ Key Improvements

### **Before:**
- ❌ Mock prediction events with fake data
- ❌ Hardcoded event IDs and pool amounts
- ❌ No connection to actual smart contract

### **After:**
- ✅ **Live blockchain events** from Base Sepolia
- ✅ **Real USDC pool amounts** (YES/NO pools)
- ✅ **Auto-refreshing data** every 30 seconds
- ✅ **Actual event statuses** (active/resolved)
- ✅ **Real end times** and time remaining
- ✅ **Live pool distribution** showing actual bets

---

## 📊 What Users Now See

### **Tab 1: Live Market (Enhanced)**
- Real cryptocurrency prices from CoinGecko API
- Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana live prices
- 24-hour price changes
- Market cap and volume data
- Auto-updates every 60 seconds

### **Tab 2: On-Chain Events (NEW!)**
Now displays **actual blockchain data**:
- ✅ **Event ID** from smart contract
- ✅ **Event Description** (e.g., "Will Bitcoin reach $100k by end of 2024?")
- ✅ **Total Pool Amount** in USDC (from blockchain)
- ✅ **YES Pool** and **NO Pool** breakdown
- ✅ **Estimated Bets** calculated from pool amounts
- ✅ **Time Remaining** until event closes
- ✅ **Status Indicator** (active/resolved)
- ✅ **Category Tags** (Crypto/DeFi/Prediction)
- ✅ **Live Indicator** showing connection to Base Sepolia

## 🔄 Auto-Refresh Behavior

| Data Type | Refresh Rate | Source |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Market Prices | 60 seconds | CoinGecko API |
| Blockchain Events | 30 seconds | Base Sepolia RPC |
| Event Status | Real-time | Smart Contract |

---

## 📈 Data Displayed

### **For Each Blockchain Event:**

1. **Event Metadata**
   - Event ID (from contract)
   - Description
   - Category (auto-detected)
   - Status (active/resolved)

2. **Pool Information**
   - Total Pool (in USDC)
   - YES Pool (in USDC)
   - NO Pool (in USDC)

3. **Participation Metrics**
   - Estimated number of bets
   - (Calculated from pool size)

4. **Time Information**
   - End timestamp
   - Time remaining
   - Human-readable format (Xd Xh or Xh Xm)

---

## 🧮 Smart Calculations

### **Estimated Bets Formula:**
```typescript
estimatedBets = Math.floor(totalPool / 0.5)
// Assumes average bet of 0.5 USDC
```

### **Category Detection:**
```typescript
if (description includes "bitcoin" OR "ethereum" OR "crypto")
  → Category: "Crypto"
else if (description includes "base" OR "tvl" OR "defi")
  → Category: "DeFi"
else
  → Category: "Prediction"
```

### **Status Logic:**
```typescript
if (event.resolved)
  → "resolved"
else if (currentTime < endTime)
  → "active"
else
  → "resolved"
```

---

## 🔒 Data Integrity

All data comes directly from the blockchain:
- ✅ **Tamper-proof** - Data cannot be modified
- ✅ **Transparent** - All events visible to everyone
- ✅ **Verifiable** - Can be checked on BaseScan
- ✅ **Real-time** - Updates reflect actual blockchain state

2. **Fetch:** `useMarketEvents()` queries blockchain
3. **Display:** Shows events with loading state
4. **Update:** Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
5. **Refresh:** New data merges seamlessly

### **Data Transform:**

```
Blockchain (smart contract)
  ↓ Raw event data
useMarketEvents() hook
  ↓ Formatted MarketEvent[]
LiveMarketFeed component
  ↓ UI-ready data
User sees live blockchain events
```

---
